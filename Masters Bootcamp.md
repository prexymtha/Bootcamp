# General Structure and Practices

## Clearing the environment

```r
rm(list = ls())
graphics.off()
cat('\f')
```

**Why?** This ensures a clean workspace, preventing unintended interactions with leftover variables, plots, or console clutter from previous sessions.  
**Preferred?** Yes, especially for reproducibility. Starting with a clean environment reduces potential debugging time.  
**Alternative?** Instead of `cat('\f')`, you can manually clear the console, but automating it keeps the workflow consistent.

## Setting the working directory dynamically

```r
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))
```

**Why?** Using `dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)` ensures the script works relative to its location, making it portable and easy to share.  
**Preferred?** Yes, over hardcoding paths, as it avoids errors when the script is moved between systems.  
**Alternative?** Manually setting the working directory (`setwd()` with a specific path), but this is less flexible.

# my_countries Function

**Purpose:** This function assigns specific countries to the user based on a predefined logic tied to a unique identifier (e.g., SU number).

**Key Elements:**

- `set.seed()`: Ensures reproducibility in random selections.
- **Why define `country_index` first?** Hardcoding two indices ensures certain countries are always included. Adding the `third_number` later introduces randomness while avoiding duplication.
- **Preferred Style?** Yes, because it balances fixed elements (specific indices) with randomness, ensuring variability without compromising control.

# Data Transformation with `mutate`

## Creating `diff_l_gdp_pcap`

```r
mutate(diff_l_gdp_pcap = c(NA, diff(l_gdp_pcap)))
```

**Why use `c(NA, diff(...))`?** The `diff()` function calculates differences between consecutive elements in a vector. However, the result has one fewer element than the original vector. Adding `NA` at the beginning ensures the new column aligns with the original data.  
**Explicit NA?** Using `c()` makes it clear that the first row lacks a preceding value to calculate a difference, avoiding silent alignment issues.  
**Alternative Approach?** A function like `dplyr::lead()` could theoretically pad the missing value, but `c()` is simple, explicit, and widely understood.  
**Preferred?** Yes, because it is straightforward and easier to interpret during debugging or future modifications.

## Creating `lag_l_gdp_pcap`

```r
mutate(lag_l_gdp_pcap = lag(l_gdp_pcap))
```

**Why `lag()`?** It shifts values by one row to create a lagged version of the variable, essential for time-series modeling.  
**Preferred Style?** Yes, `lag()` from `dplyr` is efficient and integrates seamlessly into pipelines.

# Data Tidying (`pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`)

## Why transform the data to long format first?

**Reason:** The original dataset is in wide format (years as columns), which is not ideal for time-series analysis or statistical modeling. Transforming it into long format (with "Year" as a variable) makes it easier to group and manipulate.  
**Preferred Style?** Yes, because tidy data principles advocate organizing data with one observation per row and one variable per column.

## Returning to wide format

**Why?** After aggregating and processing in long format, converting back to wide format (`pivot_wider`) is necessary to perform specific operations like column-wise calculations.  
**Preferred?** Yes, as it balances the benefits of both formats.

# Regression Models

## Using `feols` (from the `fixest` package)

**Why not `lm()`?** `feols()` supports fixed effects and is optimized for high-dimensional datasets, making it faster and more robust for large-scale regressions.  
**Preferred Style?** Yes, especially for users familiar with econometric modeling, as `fixest` is widely used in the field.

## Why multiple models (`model_2_1`, `model_2_2`, `model_2_3`)?

To explore different specifications and relationships (e.g., linear vs. lagged vs. differenced), providing a comprehensive analysis.

# Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

## Why test stationarity?

Time-series models require stationary data to produce reliable results. The ADF test evaluates whether the data has a unit root (non-stationary).  
**Preferred Approach?** Yes, as it’s a standard diagnostic step in time-series analysis.  
**Why the explicit interpretation?** The summary of the ADF test results provides statistical values, but adding a clear interpretation (`stationarity_result`) ensures the output is actionable and understandable.

# General Comments for Non-Native R Users

## Why `pacman` for package management?

**Reason:** `pacman` simplifies package installation and loading. It ensures all necessary libraries are available with a single line of code.  
**Preferred?** Yes, for its convenience, especially in scripts requiring multiple packages.

## Why `as_tsibble` for time-series data?

**Reason:** `tsibble` is designed for modern time-series workflows, supporting key features like explicit indexing and grouping by keys.  
**Preferred?** Yes, for flexibility and integration with tidyverse tools.

## Why `huxtable` for tables?

**Reason:** `huxtable` produces publication-quality tables with flexible styling options.  
**Preferred?** Yes, for polished output and customization (e.g., bold headers, captions).

# Suggestions for Improvement

- **Automate Labeling:** Instead of manually assigning labels in `mutate`, consider creating a mapping table between Indicator Code and Indicator Name.
- **Dynamic Filtering for Countries:** The logic for selecting random countries could be abstracted into a reusable function.
- **Error Handling:** Add error messages or fallbacks (e.g., if `download.file` fails) to make the script more robust.

# Preferred Style

The approach taken is methodical and balances clarity with functionality. While there’s room for minor optimizations, the script aligns well with best practices, ensuring both immediate usability and long-term maintainability.
